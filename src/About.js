          Hi, I'm Ariel! I'm currently an undergraduate studying 
          computer science. I grew up in New York and still think
          it has the best subway system and baseball team in the country.
          I loved math in high school, but eventually discovered that I
          liked applying those problem solving skills to build products that people can use.
          I have full-stack development experience, but I'm most excited 
          by work on customer-facing features. Data visualization in particular 
          is at the intersection of several of my interests; I'm especially
          fascinated by its applications in healthcare and journalism. 
          In my free time, I enjoy traveling, photography, comedy in live or podcast form, and
          science fiction novels.
