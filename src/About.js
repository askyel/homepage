          Hi, I'm Ariel! I'm currently studying computer science at MIT,
          with a minor in Data Science & Statistics, and a concentration
          in Women & Gender Studies. I grew up in New York and still think
          it has the best subway system and baseball team in the country.
          I loved math in high school, but eventually found the concrete
          results of computer science to be more fulfilling in college.
          I have full-stack development experience, but I'm most excited
          by product-oriented engineering. Data visualization especially
          is at the intersection of a lot of my interests and I'm fascinated
          by its applications in healthcare and journalism in particular.

          On campus, I spend my time outside of class with a few different
          organizations. I'm on the executive board of Women in Electrical
          Engineering and Computer Science. I'm also a unit leader,
          counselor, and fundraiser for Camp Kesem. Finally, I'm an officer
          in our campus's chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta. In all of my other
          free time, I enjoy traveling, photography, standup comedy, and
          science fiction novels.
