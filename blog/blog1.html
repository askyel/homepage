			<h1 id="blogchoosingacollege">Choosing a College</h1>

			<p class="date">December 10, 2016</p>

			<p>Choosing a college seemed like the most important decision of my life.  Those four years of undergraduate education were billed as the most formative and exciting time in life, absolutely critical to my future career and friendships and happiness. I was about to turn eighteen, leave home, and enter a world of independence; I agonized over making the right decision.</p>

			<p>If costs between schools you're considering are comparable, there are a lot of other quantifiable features that you can use to differentiate between colleges. Distance from home, enrollment size, campus size, location population, weather, ranking, etc. This is the approach I initially took. I created an enormous spreadsheet with points for each school in thirty+ different categories assigned varying weight, considering both academic and social factors. At the end I had a personal rating for each school, with a winner, but I wasn't satisfied. </p>

			<p>When faced with a decision that I can't come to a conclusion on, I often flip a coin. I'm not leaving my fate to chance, but trying to pinpoint my gut reaction to one outcome over the other. If I'm relieved, that's the outcome to choose. If I'm disappointed, I should choose the opposite outcome. </p>

			<p>This spreadsheet, and the prospect of attending the ranking-winning school, left me with that feeling of disappointment. I knew which school felt the most appealing, but I was distressed that I wasn't making the logical choice. </p>

			<p>On nearly the last possible day, I went with the feeling and committed to MIT. And after a semester, I can't imagine a better college experience. It was a hard-to-describe spirit on campus when I visited that made it feel like home, something unique that I think derives from a few key principles of the institute. </p>

			<p><strong>No honorary are degrees awarded and no classes are graded on a curve.</strong> Everyone graduates with the same degree and all grades are only based on your work. Every college claims that their community is collaborative, but it felt the most true of MIT. People here drop everything to help each other, academically and personally. One of my professors stayed at the lab until midnight helping students with final projects. A friend waited all night in the emergency room with her floormate that needed surgery. The people here care deeply about their work, but they truly care more about each other.</p>

			<p><strong>Hacking culture and boundary pushing is admired.</strong> MIT students pride themselves on the "hacking culture" of the school. Note, hacking here refers to exploring off-limits areas of the campus and pulling pranks, like that time everyone woke up to a police car on the roof of the most central building on campus. But hacking culture embodies much more than that specific act. Crossing all sorts of boundaries, academic and social and minorly criminal in the case of tresspassing is encouraged. There's even a $250K cash prize for it, called the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/disobedience-award/">Disobedience Award</a>. Of course this attitude can cause behavior that is too reckless and ends up being harmful. But I've found that MIT is almost always on the right side of that line.</p>

			<p><strong>Mens et manus.</strong> The MIT motto translates to "Mind and hand". It doesn't mean that everyone here is doing hands-on constructing, although there is plenty of that. This year students in one dorm made an enormous carousel swing and wooden fort in their backyard. But there is a dual drive towards both conceptual understanding and practical application in every academic discipline and subject. From Introductory Physics to Computational Media Design, nearly every class I took this semester challenged me to prove my internalization of knowledge through exams or essays and create something original using that knowledge. My physics project tracked rotation and acceleration of an ultimate frisbee disc. My media design project was a VR experience of Vasarely's style of  optical art. Neither my partner nor I had ever used Unity before the project, and by the end we had created something presentable with it. MIT expects it's students to figure things out on their own like that all the time. Lectures won't guide you through every detail or possible scenario of a topic. And you won't know how to build every aspect of a project before you do it. But MIT does give you the tools to learn and problem-solve independently and in my opinion that's even more valuable.</p>

			<p>I can honestly say that I've found family in my dorm, my ultimate team, my sorority, my advisor, and countless other people across campus. It is very rare that one school would be exactly right for someone. I love MIT, but it definitely isn't perfect for me. I worry that I'm missing out on a liberal arts education and the diversity of people that attracts. MIT students are definitely diverse in interests and backgrounds, but I've met one non-STEM major so far and even she spends a lot of her free time in mechanical engineering labs. The general quality and variety of the humanities classes isn't quite what I hoped it would be. If I had chosen another school, I might be saying I couldn't image anywhere else being better for different reasons. Even so, life here is wonderful and if I could choose again it would be MIT without deliberation. IHTFP.</p>
