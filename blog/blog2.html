			<p class="date">February 5, 2017</p>

			<p>MIT has an awesome program called Independent Activities Period, or IAP. For a month in the winter, school is out and students have the opportunity to pursue all kinds of activities. Some teach STEM subjects abroad, in places like Italy and Morocco. Others take condensed seminars on campus on everything from blacksmithing to politics in the Middle East. </p>

			<p>This IAP I externed at a start-up in Kendall Square called <a href="http://www.brain-power.com/">Brain Power</a>. The mission of the company is awesome – they're using neuroscience to develop augmented reality technology that aids those struggling with autism. In fact they have one of the largest collections of Google Glass devices in the world.</p>

			<p>I joined as the team lead for the App Development Team, which was working on a new game teaching emotion recognition. Over the course of the month we built a functioning system from scratch designed to work across Google Glass and Android platforms. I learned several engineering skills, like how to develop with the Unity platform and pair devices with bluetooth. </p>

			<p>While I can't speak to details of app development for proprietary reasons, I can share my experience with Scrum. Scrum is a project organization and management system that is described as an "agile framework". That means the scrum process relies on iterative evaluations of the current state and adaptations to fit future needs as the project progresses. It is super powerful for software development teams as it allows planning to be flexible and ensures a lot of separate moving parts stay on track towards project goals.</p>

			<p>The basic process is like a wheel rotating forward, a series of repeating cycles, each progressing the project. These repeating cycles are called "sprints". A sprint is usually two weeks or four weeks in length. At the beginning of a sprint, the team decides on a prioritized list of features they wish to work on during the sprint period. Ideally at the end of the sprint, all of the assigned features are completed and ready to be used. The team meets at this time to review the sprint and determine what uncompleted work needs to be moved to the next sprint.</p>

			<p>The prioritized list of features that are picked for a sprint come from a larger list of features needed for the whole project called the "product backlog". This list can constantly change based on new ideas for the project or new requests from project users. </p>

			<p>Frequently features are described in the format of a "user story". User stories are structured like, "As a [role], I want [feature] for the benefit of [benefit]." These descriptions helps us hone in on the purpose behind our engineering decisions and the people we'd like to help. </p>

			<p>The last key element of Scrum is the daily standup. At the beginning of each day, the team has a standing meeting when everyone recaps what they did the previous day, what they plan to do today, and any questions or concerns they might have. This ensures that the whole team is on the same page and the project is coming together as a whole.</p>

			<p>I modified the Scrum system that we implemented at Brain Power in a few different ways to best support the project team and timeline. Essentially, I halved the typical time period between meetings, so there were two daily scrum meetings instead of one and the sprint period was one week instead of two. I found that because </p>

			<p>The team was split into smaller groups of a few engineers. One subteam was focused on the Glass development side, one subteam was focused on the Android development side, and one team was focused on the bluetooth pairing between the two. Because of these distinctive groups, I decided that two daily scrum meetings would optimize communication between team members. One meeting was held in the morning and one was held after lunch. </p>

			<p>In addition, our sprint periods were one week long. They began on Monday morning with a planning session, features to be implemented were selected and assigned to different team members. Friday afternoons we reviewed the week's sprint and decided if any features needed to be worked on in the next sprint. </p>

			<p>Scrum allowed us to clearly define responsibilities for each team member in short-term and long-term increments. Its flexibility also allowed us to easily adapt to unexpected  challenges and delays. I appreciated the system so much that I've incorporated it into my own routine. At the beginning of each month, I like to outline a few long-term goals I'd like to accomplish or make significant progress on. Each morning, I review a general list of todos and pull out a few main tasks to focus on completing. I've found that this system really holds me accountable to my goals and makes my work more focused and productive. </p>
