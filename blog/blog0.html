			<h1 id="bloggoodbyestuy">Graduation</h1>

			<p class="date">June 30, 2016</p>

			<p>Stuyvesant High School is just about the closest thing to a pure meritocracy that I think I'll ever experience. Admission is based on one, city-wide standardized exam. Grades are based on exam scores. Registration in AP classes and other advanced electives is based on grades. Achievement was the currency of the school and there was constant pressure to be as close to the top as possible. This created a two-sided culture of both unhealthy competition and boundless work ethic. </p>

			<p>On one hand, I was pushed to pursue opportunites I never would have otherwise. An introductory computer science class was mandatory and the department offered electives more advanced than the AP curriculum. I had the chance to see Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Wolfram Alpha, speak in the auditorium. I traveled to nation-wide competitions with the math team. </p>

			<p>On the other hand, school was mentally and emotionally taxing. Expectactions of success run very high and the spectre of college admissions is a weight on many students minds. I had too many friends that struggled with anxiety, depression, and even suicide attempts. </p>

			<p>So while I won't Stuyvesant as an institution, I will miss the people and the relationships I formed there. My teachers truly shaped my mindset and career trajectory. I would never have discovered and pursued my passion for engineering without their support and guidance. The friends I made here are brilliant and talented and have inspired me in so many different ways. Stuyvesant was in turn toxic and invaluable, but it was without a doubt transformative. Cheers to the class of 2016!</p>
